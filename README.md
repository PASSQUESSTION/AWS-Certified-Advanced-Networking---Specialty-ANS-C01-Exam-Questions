		3. A software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider hosts its solution on Amazon EC2 instances within a VPC in the AWS Cloud. All of the provider's customers also have their environments in the AWS Cloud.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
A recent design meeting revealed that the customers have IP address overlap with the provider's AWS deployment. The customers have stated that they will not share their internal IP addresses and that they do not want to connect to the provider's SaaS service over the internet.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
Which combination of steps is part of a solution that meets these requirements? (Choose two.)<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
A.Deploy the SaaS service endpoint behind a Network Load Balancer.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
B.Configure an endpoint service, and grant the customers permission to create a connection to the endpoint service.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
C.Deploy the SaaS service endpoint behind an Application Load Balancer.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
D.Configure a VPC peering connection to the customer VPCs. Route traffic through NAT gateways.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
E.Deploy an AWS Transit Gateway, and connect the SaaS VPC to it. Share the transit gateway with the customers. Configure routing on the transit gateway.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
Answer: A, B

		4. A company is deploying a new application in the AWS Cloud. The company wants a highly available web server that will sit behind an Elastic Load Balancer. The load balancer will route requests to multiple target groups based on the URL in the request. All traffic must use HTTPS. TLS processing must be offloaded to the load balancer. The web server must know the user’s IP address so that the company can keep accurate logs for security purposes.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
Which solution will meet these requirements?<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
A.Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
B.Deploy an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Include the X-Forwarded-For request header with traffic to the targets.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
C.Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener. Use path-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
D.Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a TLS listener for each domain. Use host-based routing rules to forward the traffic to the correct target group for each domain. Configure client IP address preservation for traffic to the targets.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;" />
Answer: A
